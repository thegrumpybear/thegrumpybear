Hya all. Please post all future aggression reports on the coalition server under the category "Aggressive Alliance Monitoring". There are individual channels there to separate out offenses from known problematic alliances from random offenses. Please post the report in the appropriate channel. "other_miscellaneous" is for those offenses that don't fit into one of the other channels. By using this method, we can easily identify trends, communicate coalition-wide, and respond accordingly. This alliance-specific one will be deleted on Friday morning. Thanks all!
